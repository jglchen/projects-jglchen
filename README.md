# Build Applications from Website to Mobile - John Chen's Professional Profile

This is a **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** framework site to illustrate John Chen's professional profile.

Next.js has two different routers: the App Router and the Pages Router. For this project the newly developed **App Router** is adopted, therefore we can use several latest features, such as server components, streaming, server actions, etc. The pages are styled with Tailwind CSS. A theme toggling mechanism is included for users to switch between light theme and dark theme. A theme toggling mechanism is included for users to switch between the light theme and the dark theme. In addition, a bilingual selection is provided for the pages, users can freely choose either English or traditional Chinese to view.
