This is a **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** framework site to illustrate John Chen's professional profile.

Next.js has two different routers: **the App Router** and **the Pages Router**. For this project the newly developed **App Router** is adopted, therefore we can use several latest features, such as server components, streaming, server actions, etc. The pages are styled with Tailwind CSS. **A theme toggling mechanism** is included for users to switch between the light theme and the dark theme. In addition, **a bilingual selection** is provided for the pages, users can freely choose either English or traditional Chinese to view.  

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/projects-jglchen/builds/05e970e6-dfc6-434a-9a95-a9161b872a1c) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/projects-jglchen/builds/fe31f009-3fa3-4e57-8ecd-be1cfe2fa1e6).
