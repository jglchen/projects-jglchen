This example creates an authentication system that uses a signed and encrypted cookie to store session data. It uses current best practices as for authentication in the Next.js ecosystem, we use **useUser** custom hook together with **[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)** for data fetching.

* Firebase Authentication with Email/Password, Google Sign In, GitHub Sign, and Email Sign available to authenticate users.
* The emails registered in Firebase Authentication are saved in a separate database for future data development of individual users, for this illustration Firestore Database.
* Session data is signed and encrypted in a cookie.

In addition, **iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/firebase-auth/builds/da8ba431-1739-4dd2-8735-2a2a65836d18) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/firebase-auth/builds/987f6f8c-d8bd-41f0-95d0-43be634e3bf2).
