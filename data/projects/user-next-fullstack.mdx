Laravel Breeze is an implementation of all of Laravel&apos;s authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation.
Breeze includes a simple &quot;profile&quot; page where the user may update their name, email address, and password. 

This project tries to use **Next.js full-stack functionalities emulating Laravel Breeze**.
Laravel Breeze&apos;s default view layer is made up of simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. The Next.js React front pages are also styled with Tailwind CSS to follow Laravel Breeze&apos;s view designs.
In this project, Prisma as an ORM is used to manage the database, as Eloquent is adopted to connect Laravel with the database.
