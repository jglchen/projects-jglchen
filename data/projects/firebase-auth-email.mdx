This example creates an authentication system that uses a **signed and encrypted cookie to store session data**. It uses current best practices as for authentication in the Next.js ecosystem, we use **`useUser` custom hook**  together with [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching.
   
* Firebase Authentication with Email Passwordless Link is used to authenticate users.
* Session data is signed and encrypted in a cookie.
      
**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/firebase-auth-email/builds/0f15f092-b8d8-4bc1-ac03-bf703c0d3edd) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/firebase-auth-email/builds/fb497610-636a-48ef-8686-725e40d19ed1).
