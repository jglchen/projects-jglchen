This is a [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) clone site built with **next.js** implementing GraphQL APIs, for which Apollo Client is adopted in the frontend and Apollo Server in the backend server. We can successfully build a full functionality of GraphQL server with **next.js**, including **queries**, **mutations**, and **subscriptions**. 

The real-time communication of subscriptions however was found not to function well once the package is deployed to Vercel, which is a serverless platform. Therefore real-time [Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) is used to substitute GraphQL subscriptions.

In addition, **iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/hackernews-apollo/builds/b6aa3b39-e2ec-48cd-89f5-14028feff519) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/hackernews-apollo/builds/5b979dee-6874-48a8-ade1-231a750eca9c).
