Laravel Breeze is an implementation of all of Laravel&apos;s authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation.
Breeze includes a simple &quot;profile&quot; page where the user may update their name, email address, and password.

Laravel Breeze&apos;s default view layer comprises simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. Or, Breeze can scaffold the application using Vue or React and Inertia.
Laravel Breeze can also scaffold an authentication API ready to authenticate modern JavaScript applications such as Next, and others.

This project tries to **use Laravel Breeze API as the backend and set up authentication with Next.js as the browser frontend**. Laravel Sanctum is incorporated with Laravel Breeze to provide the authentication system.
In addition to API tokens, Sanctum offers a simple way to authenticate single-page applications (SPAs) that need to communicate with a Laravel-powered API.
For this, Sanctum uses Laravel&apos;s built-in cookie-based session authentication services.
The Next.js React front pages are styled with Tailwind CSS to follow Laravel Breeze&apos;s default view designs.
