            Internet traffic from mobile devices has surpassed the traffic from desktops for many years. 
            With each passing year, the gap between mobile and desktop usage is becoming more pronounced.

            A native mobile application is developed for use on a particular platform or device. 
            In Android development, people can write codes in Kotlin or Java; in iOS, you can use Swift or Objective-C. <strong>React Native</strong> is a framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities.

            By following similar plan designs, you can construct rich UI for native applications by iOS and Android.
